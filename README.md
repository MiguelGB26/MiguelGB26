- 👀 I’m interested in building applications with C# and exploring backend development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in C# like asynchronous programming, LINQ, and working with APIs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C# projects, especially those related to web services or desktop applications.
